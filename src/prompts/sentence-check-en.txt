GRAMMAR_ANALYSIS(Parsing required):
This sentence follows a simple subject-verb-object (SVO) structure, which is the most common sentence pattern in English.

**Subject Analysis**: "She" is a third-person singular pronoun that serves as the subject of the sentence. It refers to a female person who is performing the action.

**Verb Analysis**: "reads" is the main verb in simple present tense. It shows a habitual or regular action. Since the subject is third-person singular ("she"), the verb correctly takes the "-s" ending, demonstrating proper subject-verb agreement.

**Object Analysis**: "books" is a plural noun that functions as the direct object. It receives the action of the verb "reads" and tells us what she is reading.

**Grammar Rules Demonstrated**: This sentence shows correct subject-verb agreement (she reads, not she read), proper use of simple present tense for habitual actions, and clear direct object placement.

GRAMMAR_CORRECTION(Parsing required):
The sentence is grammatically correct and needs no changes.

However, for variety, you could also say: "She reads novels" or "She enjoys reading books" to add more specificity or express the action differently.
